# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you
wish to make via an issue, email to the maintainers, or any other method
with the maintainers of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your
interactions with the project.

## Submitting an issue.

1.  Create a clear and concise title for your issue.
2.  Issue should include a concise summary. Include a screenshot, output, or
    relevant data for the issue.
3.  Include steps to reproduce the issue in a step by step text process.
4.  Any other relevant information to the issue being reported. Explain why
    you consider this an issue.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Update CHANGELOG.md with details of the changes implemented. This includes
    any tests created as well.
2.  Don't break any old tests or functionality when updating unless the test has
    been determined to be wrong. (requires discussion beforehand)
3.  Add tests for any new functionality in the appropriate `test` folder
    in the source tree. Tests should be comprehensive to make sure the kernel
    does not lose stability.
4.  Any commits *must* be gpg signed with a key associated with your account.
    This keeps a chain of custody to allow proper back tracking of commits.
5.  Pull requests should be flattened into a single commit where relevant.
6.  Recognize that all code will be considered under the license found in 
    LICENSE.md, any code which cannot be legally distributed under this license
    will not be considered for pull requests.

## Coding style
All code should follow the standard coding style enforced herein.

1.  80 column lines. This should be practiced as a semi-hard rule. If there are
    commands that break this, consider rewriting them, or splitting them between
    two lines if possible.
2.  K&R style bracing should be used consistently.
3.  Comments should be used, but not overused for obvious content. Comments
    should use the c++ `//` style except for file descriptors at the beginning
    of each file, and function description blocks, following the doxygen 
    standard. Comments should not include any inappropriate or offensive
    language.
4.  Avoid monolithic functions. Indented code should never drop below 4 indents.
    Consider exposing that to a separate function or rewriting the logic at that
    point.
